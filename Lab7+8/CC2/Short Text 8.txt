The unreal is more powerful than the real. Because nothing is as perfect as you can imagine it. 
Because its only intangible ideas, concepts, beliefs, fantasies that last. Stone crumbles. 
Wood rots. People, well, they die. But things as fragile as a thought, a dream, a legend, they 
can go on and on. If you can change the way people think. The way they see themselves. The way 
they see the world. You can change the way people live their lives. That's the only lasting 
thing you can create.
