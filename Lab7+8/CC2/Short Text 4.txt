People disappear when they die. Their voice, their laughter, the warmth of their breath. Their flesh. 
Eventually their bones. All living memory of them ceases. This is both dreadful and natural. Yet for some there 
is an exception to this annihilation. For in the books they write they continue to exist. We can rediscover 
them. Their humor, their tone of voice, their moods. Through the written word they can anger you or make you 
happy. They can comfort you. They can perplex you. They can alter you. All this, even though they are dead. 
Like flies in amber, like corpses frozen in the ice, that which according to the laws of nature should pass 
away is, by the miracle of ink on paper, preserved. It is a kind of magic.
